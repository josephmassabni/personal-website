        <h1>Learn more about me!</h1>
        <h3>If you are interested in what I have done outside of the web development world, I have compiled together everything I am involved with.</h3>
        <h3>There are three key aspects of my life that I am heavily involved in: my community, my workplace, and my school. These three places have shaped me into who I am today; I would not trade my experiences for the world! </h3>
        <h3>I am driven by these places to make an impact, whether that be through creating clubs to address gaps in my school's curriculum, being a good employee, or helping the less fortunate.</h3>
        <h3>As I move on to the next chapter of my life, I hope to continue diving deeper into many of the activities I have been involved in, but I am also excited to try new things and explore new passions!</h3>
        <h3>But don't take these words for it- check out my resume down below!</h3>
