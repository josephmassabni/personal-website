One day, however, I learned that I could create a website for my robotics team in hopes of qualifying for Worlds. Although we did not win an award, I am very happy I embraced the challenge. I was able to learn the basics of HTML and the Bootstrap framework. By the end, I also gained a basic knowledge of CSS and used it to a limited extent on some aspects of the website. The biggest challenges I faced were trying to do way too much at first- I realized that I would have to start simple and work from there! That was a very humbling realization to have. But, I was able to incorporate some of the complex aspects that I planned into my website. In short, I attribute this project to my interest in web development!</p>

They needed a website very quickly in order to keep their work going strong. In order to make it easy for them to post new content if needed, I decided to continue using the Wordpress software that they were previously using. Going from custom programming to a webpage maker seemed like a huge step backwards at first, but eventually I was able to learn to appreciate Wordpress and its ability to allow any organization to create a website quickly and effectively. I was still able to include some custom HTML that allowed this project to still be unique. Most of all, I was happy that I could use my web development knowledge to help a meaningful cause.</p>

I learned so much more about animating elements to make them seem much more interactive and visually appealing. To me, this website felt much more professional than anything I have created in the past. In addition, I focused on making the website responsive on all devices, something I struggled with on my previous projects. I spent much more time learning about the different ways the sizes of elements can be manipulated in order to make a website easily accessible for all users, something that is becoming very important as mobile phones are becoming more and more popular. I feel that this is the most polished website I have created so far!</p>

I feel that my prior projects allowed me to do this so quickly and I am happy with the result. Even more important to me, I was able to apply my skills in order to make a difference in the world! </p>
